/**
 * @brief Base interface for gate builders.
 * @see `icarus::trigger::DynamicTriggerGateBuilder`,
 *      `icarus::trigger::FixedTriggerGateBuilder`
 * 
 * This base class provides a skeleton building algorithm that can be customised
 * by templates.
 * The allowed customization includes what to do when a threshold is crossed
 * in a gate.
 * 
 * The algorithm considers samples grouped in blocks of fixed (but configurable)
 * size. Each block is treated as a "macro-sample" and assigned a level based on
 * the value of its samples and a time based on a fixed, configurable offset
 * from its first sample (`BlockTimeReference`).
 * Currently, the level of the block is always taken as the _largest_ of the
 * levels of the enabled samples in the block (`SamplingPattern`), where the
 * level of the sample is how much above the baseline the sample is.
 * 
 * Note that actions are performed only when a block crosses a threshold.
 * The algorithm keeps track at each time of which are the thresholds enclosing
 * the signal level, and if the level crosses one of them, the gates associated
 * to those thresholds, and only them, are offered a chance to react.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * ### Time alignment of the waveforms
 * 
 * The algorithm uses "blocks" of samples to determine the state of the gate.
 * The start of the first block is always aligned with the start of the waveform
 * (effectively, the algorithm uses the index of the sample in the waveform).
 * While this is arbitrary, it happens to be appropriate for the CAEN V1730
 * boards, which can "trigger" only in multiples of 16 nanoseconds from an
 * absolute reference, provided that the required alignment is a divisor
 * 16 ns.
 * 
 * Note that the timestamp of the waveforms may have an arbitrary shift,
 * which is common to all waveforms on the same channel in the entire event.
 * This timestamp is eventually used to turn the block tick into a time on the
 * output gate, so that the gates from different channels are correctly
 * synchronised (and can be used to simulate real time coincidence).
 * The blocks themselves may appear not to be synchronized between channels due
 * to the channel-dependent time offsets and corrections.
 * 
 * For simulation, the input waveforms need to preserve this discretization
 * (16 ns) in order for this mechanism to exactly reproduce the hardware.
 * If that's not the case, simulation will not yield the exact result that
 * hardware would, however the results should be statistically equivalent.
 * 
 * 
 * Specific configuration
 * -----------------------
 * 
 * All classes derived by this base algorithm should support the following
 * configuration parameters:
 *  * `SamplingPattern` (sequence of switches, default: `[ true ]`): the sample
 *    pattern used to detect a single gate change. The size of this sequence
 *    determines the size of the block of samples used to detect a change.
 *    The state is open if any of the samples in the block marked with `true`
 *    passes the threshold, and closed if all the samples in the block marked
 *    with `true` do not pass the threshold; the values of samples marked with
 *    `false` is always ignored. The first block starts with the sample `0` of
 *    the input, unless `SampleOffset` is specified, in which case it starts
 *    from it instead (see below).
 *    For example, a pattern of `[ true, true, true, true ]` will determine the
 *    state based on the values of four samples, declaring an open state if any
 *    of the four samples passes the threshold, and a closed state if no sample
 *    out of four passes that threshold. A pattern of
 *    `[ true, false, false, false ]` will instead only use one sample every
 *    four to determine the state of the gate for all four samples, ignoring the
 *    other three. The default, `[ true ]`, treats all the samples
 *    independently.
 *  * `BlockTimeReference` (integer, default: `0`): for each pattern, which
 *    is the sample providing its time; for example, if `BlockTimeReference`
 *    is `2` when an opening or closing is caused by a pattern, that change is
 *    recorded at the time of its third (#2) sample.
 *  * `SampleOffset` (non-negative integer; default: `0`): skips this many
 *    samples at the beginning of each waveform. This parameter is intended to
 *    provide an offset for the block alignment.
 * 
 * The configuration option `SamplePrescale` has been discontinued. It is
 * possible to achieve the same functionality of `SamplePrescale: N` by
 * specifying a pattern of `N` elements with only the first set, like in
 * `[ 1, 0, 0, ... ]`.
